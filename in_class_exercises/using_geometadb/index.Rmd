# Welcome {-}

This book is a tutorial-style rewrite of a lecture on *where to find expression data* and
*how to mine GEO metadata with the `GEOmetadb` package*. It is designed for
fourth-year bioinformatics students and focuses on reproducible code that you
can run as-is.

If you're new to **bookdown**, install it with:

```r
install.packages("bookdown")
```

Then build this book by running in R:

```r
bookdown::render_book(".")
```
