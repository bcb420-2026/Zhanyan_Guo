# GEO Datatypes

GEO organizes data into several related entities:

- **GSE — Series**: links related samples and describes the study; may include archives of raw/processed files.
- **GSM — Sample**: per‑sample description and data; each GSM belongs to exactly one platform (GPL).
- **GPL — Platform**: array/sequencer description; many GSMs can map to a single GPL.
- **GDS — Dataset**: curated collections of comparable samples on the same platform with uniform processing.
